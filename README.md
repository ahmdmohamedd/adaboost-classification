# adaboost-classification
This project implements an AdaBoost classifier on the Iris dataset, achieving 100% accuracy, precision, and recall. The weak learner is a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1, making it an efficient and interpretable ensemble learning model. The notebook includes evaluation metrics and visualizations.
